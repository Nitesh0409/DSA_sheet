# DSA Concepts & Solutions in C++

A concept-driven C++ repository showcasing my understanding and implementation of core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** patterns.  
This repository emphasizes **problem-solving depth, clean code, and systematic coverage** of related problems rather than isolated solutions.

---

## Overview

- Implements DSA concepts and patterns with **increasing complexity**
- Each topic includes:
  - Base problems to establish fundamentals
  - Related and advanced problems derived from the same concept
  - Multiple approaches where applicable  
    *(Brute → Optimized → Optimal)*
- Consistent use of **time and space complexity analysis**
- Focus on **readable, maintainable, interview-quality C++ code**

---

## Repository Structure

- Organized **topic-wise**, with each folder representing a distinct DSA concept
- Problems grouped to reflect **progressive learning and pattern recognition**
- Code written with:
  - Clear logic
  - Modularity
  - Best C++ practices
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude binaries and temporary files

---

## Purpose

- Demonstrates **strong DSA fundamentals** and problem-solving skills
- Highlights ability to **identify and apply algorithmic patterns**
- Serves as a **technical portfolio** for:
  - Interviews
  - Coding assessments
  - Competitive programming preparation

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
